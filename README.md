Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding

When we purchase any electronic machine then a customer care will explain everything about the electronic goods. Basically Chatbot is just like a customer care which usually can answer just simple questions, such as store locations and hours, directions and maybe even making appointments. When any user input (question) falls out of the scope of the predetermined question set of Chatbot, it typically tells us to rephrase our sentence or mention that this question is not valid.

In this project, there is another option. If the customers' question is about the operation of a device, the application passes the question onto the IBM Watson Discovery Service,which has been preloaded with the device’s owners manual. So now, instead of “Wouldyou like to speak to a customer representative?” we return relevant sections of the owner are manual to help solve our customers’ problems. To take it a step further, the project uses the Smart Document Understanding featur of IBM Watson Discovery Service to train it on what text in the owner’s manual is Important and what is not. This improves the answers returned from the queries.
